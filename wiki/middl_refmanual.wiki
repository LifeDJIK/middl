= Reading midifiles =

To read a midifile you need to define 5 functions and pass them to the mf_read() function.

{{{

int mf_read( char          *fname      ,  // Midi file to read
             mf_fn_error    fn_error   ,  // called on error
             mf_fn_header   fn_header  ,  // called when the header is read
             mf_fn_track    fn_track   ,  // called when a track starts or ends
             mf_fn_midi_evt fn_midi_evt,  // called on each midi event
             mf_fn_sys_evt  fn_sys_evt    // called on each sys event
           )

}}}

{{{
int fn_error    (short err, char *msg);
}}}

{{{
int fn_header   (short type, short ntracks, short division);
}}}

{{{
int fn_track    (short eot, short tracknum, unsigned long tracklen);
}}}

{{{
int fn_midi_evt (unsigned long delta, short type, short chan, short data1, short data2);
}}}

{{{
int fn_sys_evt  (unsigned long delta, short type, short aux, long len, unsigned char *data);
}}}
